# BeeZero

BeeZero is an open-source keystroke injection USB stick.
It's inspired by the [Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky],
and meant as a tool for educational and training purposes.

## Hardware

The BeeZero project is designed for the [Arduino MKR Zero],
but can run on any Arduino that supports the [Keyboard library].
The MKR Zero is chosen mostly for its built-in SD card slot and small form factor,
requiring very minimal work to set everything up.

## BeeScript

The BeeZero runs a simple custom scripting language called BeeScript.
For the scripting documentation, see [BeeScript.md](BeeScript.md).
